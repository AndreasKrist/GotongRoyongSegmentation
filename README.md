# Road Crack Segmentation Project

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of various models for **road crack segmentation**, including:  
- **Canny Edge Detection**  
- **Watershed Algorithm**  
- **U-Net**  
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**  

Each model has been evaluated for its performance in segmenting road cracks, with datasets sourced from Kaggle and Roboflow.

## Datasets

1. **Kaggle Dataset**  
   - Used for training and testing the **Canny Edge**, **Watershed**, and **U-Net** models.  
   - [Add link here]  

2. **Roboflow Datasets**  
   - Two datasets combined to train the **YOLO model**.  
   - [Add links here]  

---

## Models and Frameworks

1. **Canny Edge Detection**  
   - Traditional edge detection method using OpenCV.  

2. **Watershed Algorithm**  
   - A classical segmentation algorithm.  

3. **U-Net**  
   - Deep learning-based segmentation model, implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.  

4. **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**  
   - Object detection model sourced from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co).
